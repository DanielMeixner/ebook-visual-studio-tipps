# Peek Definition

## Description
You can peek into the definition of a method using ALT+F12. 

## Guidance
1. Open a C# project.
2. Find a line of code that calls a method and place the cursor into the method call.
3. Hit ALT+F12.
4. A little overlay will appear showing the definition of this method.

5. Now move your cursor into the overlay. You can even edit code in there or call Peek Definition again.
6. Calling Peek Definition again will result in a cascading call of peeks - you can follow the peek using the little breadcrumb on top of the peek preview.
