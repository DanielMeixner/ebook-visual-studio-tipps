# Foreword
Dear reader!
This book was created for several reasons.
First, I wanted to find out if it could be an appropriate way to write a book using GitHub, in public and with multiple authors.
Then, I wanted to see if this could be a valid way to write technical documentation. Today the wheels are turning fast and almost every technical book feels old when it is published. So why not be more agile when it comes to writing?
Next, I'm sure when the topic is well chosen content can get better, if more people contribute to it. 
And finally I was just curious to see if I get VSTS to build epubs. I'm a fan of my ebook reader - and sometimes I wish I could just download the whole docs.microsoft.com site to it.

Have fun reading and contributing.
While this is a very early state, have fun commenting!
