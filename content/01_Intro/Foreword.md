# Foreword
## Dear reader
This book was created for several reasons.
First, I wanted to find out if it could be an appropriate way to write a book using GitHub, in public and with multiple authors.
Then, I wanted to see if this could be a valid way to write technical documentation. Today the wheels are turning fast and almost every technical book feels old when it is published. So why not be more agile when it comes to writing?
Next, I'm sure when the topic is well chosen content can get better, if more people contribute to it. 
And finally I was just curious to see if I get VSTS to build epubs. I'm a fan of my ebook reader - and sometimes I wish I could just download the whole docs.microsoft.com site to it.

## About the content
What makes a tip a tip? When is a feature of Visual Studio something I'd call a tip? When is it "just a feature". It certainly depends. My approach would be to call something a tip if it's not obvious and none of the big features. Rather one of the little things which come in handy from time to time. Often shortcuts are good tips - especially the once you need 20 times a day but which aren't well known. So let's just put it this way: This book should not replace docs.microsoft.com. It's supposed to be a fun literature which gives you some chance to discover something new.

Have fun reading!
And While this is a very early state, have fun commenting, contributing, sharing.
